#Google Backed CMS service
- In the old days I used Google Docs to act as the WYSIWYG for a projects site outlining items while I was in college
- Now I want to create a CMS that is totally backed by Google Docs and has Tag based embedding mechanism for Ruby
- I want to extend this concept to work with PHP in the future
